# markdown-editor

_**NOTE:** This project is still in progress. Parsing the JSON string still has some problems_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
and forked from [My boilerplate](https://github.com/jakedakwins/reace-boilerplate)


### About

This project is a simple markdown editor using react and react-markdown.

__Why, you ask?__

I got tired of copying markdown, removing the line breaks, and replacing them with newline characters for my site (since I don't have it hooked up to a CMS quite yet).

I didn't know of any simple tool to do this so I built one.

There are 3 key elements to this project:

1. An editor pane
2. A preview pane
3. The ability to copy a json compatible string to the clipboard

### Instructions

- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/jakedawkins/markdown-editor`
- `cd markdown-editor`
- To start: `npm start`
- To build for production: `npm run build`
